                <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
                <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do 
                    as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Burpee</dt>
                	<dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your 
                        strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop 
                        into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet 
                        back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a 
                        squatted position. 
                        <span class="views" onclick="burpees()">View Example</span></dd>
                	
                	<dt>Plank</dt>
                	<dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get 
                        in a push-up position and rest your forearms on the floor. 
                        Hold the position as long as you can. 
                        <span class="viewex" onclick="plank()">View Example</span></dd>
                    </dd>
                	
                	<dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                	<dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your 
                        hands on the floor in a push-up position, bring one knee 
                        up to your chest, and then switch as quickly as you can 
                        (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
